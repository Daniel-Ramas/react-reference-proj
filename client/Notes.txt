Redux-Form has greate documentation for handling forms with a redux store
Redux-Form has a built in reducer to handle these actions
Field is a type of input and will require a property of "name"
also it needs component to tell redux what to display on screen

Redux Form handles all the connections to the store and what not
our only job is connect the prop passed from the component to the value
and to connect the onChange handle (of the DOM) to the component handler

redux form also has a prop called handleSubmit to be called when the
form is submitted

Field is a component
and it contains all these different methods and values
when we make a field component at the StreamCreate component for example
we can pass props down by calling them at the initializaiton


JSON Server is for prototyping and mocking an actual backend server like
express

REST conventions is a standardized system for designing APIs

Action -> method -> route

If we follow REST-ful conventions we can create action creators 
without having any components to show the responses

the reducers for FETCH, EDIT & CREATE will all return 1 stream

lodash is used for takign the hassle out of working with arrays numbers objects strings

mapKeys function from lodash will take an array and make into objects

_.mapKeys(streams, 'id)
streams -> the name of the obj
'id' the property inside the obj to assign to be the key of the new obj

will return a new objects

when using the combineReducer, the key value pair is essentially
an element of a new global state object

we dont wanna navigate immediately back to localhost:3000 after the stream
was created because if the api returns an error then the stream wont
show

only navigate after a successful api response

implementing Programmatic navigation
BrowserRouter creates its own history object
need to make our own history to navigate

import BrowserRouterHistory from 'history' (root level) **history.js
import history from history

at App.js pass history as prop on Router component
at action creator (because action is called when clicking button)
history.push('/path to whatever page u wanna go to')

Each component in react router will need to fetch its own data
which makes sense, you can't expect pages to rely on each other

put=replace all
patch=replace some

USING PORTALS (Good for making sure the user does something in order to
nav out of it)

Create a modal using ReactDOM.createPortal
pass a second argument of the div u want to attach to, NOT root
make a new one

Add link tags to DOM elements that will nav you to another page

CONTEXT SYSTEM: Big Topic
    Gets data from a parent component to ANY nested child component

PROPS SYSTEM: Already been using this
    Gets data from a parent component to a direct child component
